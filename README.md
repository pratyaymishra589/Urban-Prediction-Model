# Urban detection model

This is a classification model for detection of urban features such as buildings from satellite imagery. 

The model uses multispectral data from Sentinel 2 and radar based imagery from the synthetic-aperture radar (C-SAR) instrument on Sentinel 1 to classify pixels as urban or non-urban features.
